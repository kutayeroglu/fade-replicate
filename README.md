# FADE Replicate 

**CMPE593 - Deep Learning for Computer Vision, Term Project**
This project focuses on replicating FADE, a task-agnostic upsampling operator for encoder-decoder architectures.

While FADE is designed for a variety of tasks, this implementation specifically covers object detection.
